### Getting Started
The project depends on [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) and [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com). Assuming
you already have **Node.js** installed on your system, run the following command:

```
sudo npm install -g gulp bower
```

Next, clone the repository and install project dependencies:
```bash
# Fetch only the latest commits.
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:sahat/requirejs-library.git

cd requirejs-library

bower install
npm install
```

With [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) you get the following libraries:
- **Almond** - A replacement AMD loader for RequireJS, providing the minimal AMD API footprint.
- **Require.js** - Used as an asynchronous module loader.
- **Jasmine** - Popular BDD testing framework.
- **Mocha** - Another great testing framework.
- **Chai** - BDD/TDD assertion library (used with Mocha).

And with **npm** you get the following packages:
- **Gulp** - Ultra-fast JavaScript task runner.
- **Require.js** - Used as an optimization tool that lets you to compile a single, minified JavaScript file.
- **Karma** - Awesome JavaScript test runner.


### Usage

This library is flexible enough to work as an inline **\<script\>** declaration, 
**Require.js** module, or in this case as a **Node.js** module:

You can run all demos right away *out of the box*, but if you have changed any of the **src** files, simply run the
following command to re-build the library and start watching for changes:
```
gulp
```

### Source Maps

Require.js optimizer comes with a built-in support to generate source maps. It is already enabled in **gulpfile**
by default, but feel free to disable source maps. Refer to [this article](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/javascript-debugging#source-maps)
to enable source maps in Google Chrome, if you haven't already done so.

### Tests
Go to the **test** folder and run *SpecRunnerJasmine.html* and you should see the following page:

Only 2 out of 3 specs in the **test/spec** folder are written for the Jasmine testing framework: `slugify.js`, `random.js`.
For your project pick either **Jasmine** or **Mocha + Chai**, whichever one you prefer the most. Both testing frameworks
are excellent.

The other file, `capitalize.js` is written for the Mocha testing framework, using Chai's *should* assertions. 
Run the *SpecRunnerMocha.html* and you should see the following page:
![alt text](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-asAAIpVt_eI/UoB47vwV8ZI/AAAAAAAADgA/NT2Nu1bf1DU/w1238-h984-no/Screenshot+2013-11-11+01.15.55.png)

And lastly, if you prefer to run your tests with **Karma**, simply run:
```
npm test
```

Or if you have installed **Karma** globally via npm, first run `karma start`, then `karma run`. It will perform
a single test run using **Jasmine** testing framework via **PhantomJS** headless browser. Both testing framework
and browser are configurable in **karma.conf.js**. 

I have set `autoWatch: false` by default.
So, if you use something like *JetBrains WebStorm 7* for development, then you should keep `autoWatch` turned off.

### Structure

- **demo** - examples with Inline, AMD, CommonJS script loading
- **dist** - minified JavaScript file + source map
- **src**/*mylib.js* - entry-file that pulls all other modules
- **src**/*_start.js* - adds compatibility for AMD, CommonJS and Browser globals
- **src**/*_end.js* - serves the same purpose of the initial require() call that data-main does
- **test/spec** - jasmine and mocha specs
- **test**/SpecRunnerJasmine.html - standalone jasmine html spec runner
- **test**/SpecRunnerMocha.html - standalone mocha html spec runner
- *karma.conf.js* — karma test runner configuration
- **test**/*test-main.js* — configures karma to use Require.js for the tests


### Additional Notes

- When you are changing library's name from **mylib** to **YOUR_LIBRARY_NAME**, update names in the following locations:
 - src/mylib.js: **filename**
 - gulpfile.js: **out**, `out: "dist/YOUR_LIBRARY_NAME.js"`
 - gulpfile.js: **include**, `include: ['almond', 'YOUR_LIBRARY_NAME']`
 - src/_start.js: **else** statement, `window.YOUR_LIBRARY_NAME = factory();`
 - src/_end.js: **return** statement, `require('YOUR_LIBRARY_NAME');`
